# Setting Up the Raspberry Pi and Camera

Once you obtain a Raspberry Pi and a camera to connect to it, you can run this
script on it. To do so, clone this repo (or just this folder). Then, execute
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
while in this folder. Then, set up a Sendgrid API key as described
[here](https://app.sendgrid.com/signup). Finally, start the script by running
```
python3 video_mog.py
```
